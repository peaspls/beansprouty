> The mountains we thought, far away from the cities in nature thought. Ok, so that's not entirely false, but we were surprised. Not in a good way!

### 27 - 28 april 2018

We had just gotten off the train from Vienna which is about a 6 hour journey. Our destination was Switzerland, but we wanted to take a break from a long train ride. We had decided to stay at the Hotel am Bahnhof 1 minute walking distance from Feldkirch train station. So it's really close to the train station, that was good since we were only going to stay there for one night. Sadly though, it was the worst hotel we had ever stayed at. We seriously dubbed it "Hell am Bahnhof". Keep away! I don't want to put too much energy into writing a long story about this place, so I'll be short. Everything in the room including the bed sheets smelled of cigarettes. I was able to fall asleep around 3 am after they finally shut off the music coming from the bar below us. It looked like the locals sitting there were around 50+, but it was difficult to see through all the smoke in the room. Yes, you have to go passed to bar to get to your room. At 6 am I woke up from intense cigarette smoke and noise from outside the window where construction workers were doing their job and smoking. A don't think you will enjoy this place unless you are a chain smoking alcoholic. Oh, one thing I cannot leave unsaid is that we found left over half eaten food in the closet. Ha ha! This place was cheap though.

### Food

If you happen to want soy milk in you coffee then you will have a hard time finding it. We ended up buying some simple foods at [Naturundkost](http://www.naturundkost.at/) and eating in a green area next to the river over the bridge. Not so bad :).

### Moving on

So, we didn't do much in this town. We just wanted to hop on the next train and move on. Our next stop was Buchs, Switzerland. Just another train ride away. We thought it was smart to get off here to get our Swiss Half Fare Travel Cards before buying another train ticket. Pro tip: it's possible to buy a 12 month travel card without having to live in Switzerland. The train ride to Switzerland is quite nice. It's interesting how everything becomes much nicer once you cross the Swiss border.
