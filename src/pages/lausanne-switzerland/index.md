> A year ago we traveled by train from Bern to Lausanne, stayed for 30 minutes and tok the train back to Bern in a hurry. This time we managed to stay for 2 days. It just wasn't what we imagined. For some reason we seem to not want to spend a lot of time here.

### 9 - 11 may 2018

So we didn't do much here, but we had the opportunity to eat at Bad Hunter. Good food! We stayed at Hotel Ibis Budget. Not really something I can recommend. The room was small but ok. I can't really say a lot about Lausanne since my experience here is so limited. I mean it sounds pretty good in theory, a lake, the mountains close by. Our intuition just told us that this wasn't the place we were looking for.

### Food

Incredibly tasty food at [Bad Hunter](http://badhunter.ch/).
What I liked the best was the Sun-Rice Bowl with Tofu, avocados, broccoli, kale, black rice, linseed oil & ginger shoyu sauce.
