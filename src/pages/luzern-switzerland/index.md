> Open areas, a lake, a mountain view, nice weather, swiss chocolate. Perhaps more tourists than expected, but overall a good first impression.

### 28 april - 3 may 2018

The city center is small and easy to get around. There is a lot of people here, and a lot of tourists it seems. After having walked around with our luggage, we finally found our hotel. We tried to figure out how to get inside, but after several failed attempts to contact the hotel, we gave up. We looked up another hotel 15 minutes by bus outside the city called Hotel Waldegg. Nice small clean hotel with modern interior, but not good value for your money. We stayed one night before moving on to an Airbnb apartment in Eschenbach, 15 minutes by train north of Luzern. Here we stayed from 29 april - 3 mai.

Eschenbach is a nice, safe, clean and friendly area. Nice if you want to stay outside the city. One of the things that are really cool about Switzerland is their [Zurich Vitaparcours](https://www.zurichvitaparcours.ch/de/Finder). Spread around the country they have these public running courses, usually in the forest, where you can do different exercises. It's really great! There was a Zurich Vitaparcours in the forest right behind the house we lived in. So lucky!

### Food

You can find the most delicious food at at [Blendteehaus](http://blendteehaus.ch/). Thave much more than just tee. Really tasty. You can check them out on [HappyCow](https://www.happycow.net/reviews/blend-teehaus-luzern-86442).
Then of course you have the safe [Tibits](https://www.tibits.ch/de/restaurants#tibits-luzern) which is always a winner. It's on the train station, top floor. One more place I would like to recommend is [MÃœLLER Reformhaus Vital Shop AG](https://www.google.com/maps/place/M%C3%9CLLER+Reformhaus+Vital+Shop+AG/@47.05201,8.3051428,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipMaekW3oIzKHlTizRx0mM8HIKG-ue-V4oevirB4!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMaekW3oIzKHlTizRx0mM8HIKG-ue-V4oevirB4%3Dw129-h86-k-no!7i4288!8i2848!4m8!1m2!11m1!2s180FjmycaP5k-OaGoa9lCSBrgrV0!3m4!1s0x478ffb9f070926fb:0x1b6e3402ceea5d70!8m2!3d47.051926!4d8.305192).

### Day trip to Zurich

We went on a short trip to Zurich while staying in Luzern to meet my fathers cousin and his family for the first time. A quick stop at [Hiltl](https://hiltl.ch/en/) in Zurich before taking the train to Egg just outside the city where they live. If you are ever in Zurich, try Hiltl. They have so much to offer. It's similar to Tibits.
